# BDR Reader

**This project is currently in early development and non-functioning. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!**

The modern customizable self-hosted RSS reader.

## Motivations

I became dissatisfied with the current self-hosted RSS reader solutions available due to their lack of visual appeal, functionality, and/or lack-of customization. The aim of BDR Reader is to build a beautiful, unopiniated, self-hosted RSS reader that you will actually want to use.

## Contribute

### Front-End User Interface 

The user-interface is built with Next.js, graphQL, and Material React UI (Mui).

Coding styleguide is coming soon.

Getting the development server up and running is very easy.

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the project's root folder and run `yarn install`.
3. Next, run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs), or reach out to anyone on the team.

### Back-End
